Observation #1: Most of the players are male. This falls in line with most supporting data for the gaming community. Though the gaming industry is male dominated, the number of female players/creators is on the rise.

Observation #2: Females have a higher average total purchase value. This could be because the sample size for females is much smaller than males and more susceptible to outliers.

Obersvation #3: Three of the most popular items are also three of the most profitable items. By nature, a company would want their most profitable products to be the most popular but conversely popular items typically sell the most, making them the more profitable.
